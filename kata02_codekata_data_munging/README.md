> Here’s an exercise in three parts to do with real world data. Try hard not to read ahead—do each part in turn.

## Part one: weather data

> In [weather.dat](./weather.dat) you’ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).

TODO: fix the bug where lines with asterisks are ignored.
